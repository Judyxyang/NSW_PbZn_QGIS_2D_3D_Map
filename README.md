ineral Potential Data Package improvements - December 2023

Applies to:

Central Lachlan Orogen Mineral Potential Data Package (2020)
Eastern Lachlan Orogen Mineral Potential Data Package (2019)
Zone 54 - Curnamona Province and Delamerian-Thomson Orogen Mineral Potential Data Package (2018)
Southern New England Orogen Mineral Potential Data Package (2017)

The data in these packages were reformatted and reorganised to improve the usability for end users. Improvements include:

- ESRI GRID format converted to ERDAS IMAGINE .IMG format
- Unnecessary shapefiles removed (duplication)
- Implementation of Metadata improved
- Layer names/files renamed to provide a more intuitive description (new layer names updated in the spatial data tables and reports)
- MXDs structured consistently across all 4 mineral potential data packages 
- Layer styling made consistent across all 4 mineral potential data packages
- Folder/file structure made consistent across all 4 mineral potential data packages

No reinterpretation of the data was conducted.
